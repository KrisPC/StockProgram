Hello everyone, welcome to Kris, Noah, and David's stock program!

Below is a list of instructions that will explain how to use the app, as well as what each button or function does. 

1. The check button enters the information from both the "Enter a stock" and "How many shares?" text boxes, which then calculates that value and displays the total value. 
If you happen to like that value and wish to add it to your portfolio, hit "SAVE".

2. In order to keep adding a running history of your portfolio, you must hit "SAVE" each time you wish to enter it into your portfolio.
The "CHECK" button only previews the value, but does not actually save to your History file. 

3. If you wish to clear whatever values you have been entering, hit clear. This will erase everything that has been calculated thus far
NOTE. This will not erase anything from your portfolio history.

4. If you wish to view your previous portfolio values, please hit the "OPEN PORTFOLIO" button located at the bottom of the app, and scroll to the bottom for the most recent history.

5. Please enter a negative number of shares with the same stock name that you would like to remove if you would like to take away that number of shares. Ex: Originally had 3 shares of AAPL, second time enter a -1 of AAPL to remove 1 share of AAPL
